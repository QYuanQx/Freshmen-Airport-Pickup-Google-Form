# Freshmen-Airport-Pickup-GAS
## Produced by Rice Chinese Students and Scholars Association(RCSSA) IT Team

## About
Each year more than 200 Chinese students arrive at Houston to start their new journey at Rice University. To help them quickly adapt to the new environment 
and make new friends, the RCSSA IT team developed this platform to pick up these new students from the airport. 

## Procedure
1. New students enter their arrival time and airports (IAH/HOU) through a Google form frontend. (Only Accessible to Rice University account)
2. Volunteers can see all the students that are waiting to be picked up through a Google form frontend. (Open to everyone)
3. Volunteers select the students they would like to pick up; RCSSA volunteers will inspect and verify volunteers' identities.
4. Volunteers and new students will both receive an email containing contact information from each other.

## GAS
Google App Script allows us to interact with the google suite(form, sheet, doc, gmail, etc.) in real time.
